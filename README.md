# Enhancing Central Field Visual Assessment Test

## üìä What This Project Does

This project aims to **enhance the precision of Central Field Visual Assessment Tests** for individuals who are pre-verbal or mentally challenged. It uses advanced technologies such as **eye-gaze tracking**, **signal processing**, and **machine learning models** to automate the process of assessing visual field performance.

### üéØ Key Functions:

- **Automated Vision Assessment:** Analyzes eye movement patterns to detect visual field deficiencies without the need for verbal responses.
- **Real-Time Gaze Tracking:** Tracks eye-gaze direction, blink rates, and fixation points to understand visual attention.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Processes large datasets from gaze tracking to identify visual impairments with high accuracy.
- **Intelligent Predictions:** Utilizes ensemble machine learning models to provide accurate vision assessment outcomes.
- **Fixation and Saccade Analysis:** Differentiates between stable fixations and rapid eye movements (saccades) to enhance diagnosis precision.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Offers capabilities for real-time monitoring, enabling early detection of potential visual disorders.

### üåç Impact of the Project:

- **Empowering Non-Verbal Individuals:** Provides an effective way to assess vision for individuals who cannot communicate verbally, such as infants or those with cognitive impairments.
- **Early Detection of Vision Issues:** Facilitates early intervention by identifying visual problems before they become severe.
- **Reducing Human Error:** Automates the assessment process, reducing the chances of subjective errors from manual observations.
- **Scalable Assessments:** Can be used in clinical settings, research environments, or even integrated into wearable health devices for continuous monitoring.

### üî¨ Use Cases:

- Vision screening in **neonatal care units**.
- Assessment of **cognitive and developmental disorders**.
- Enhancing **neurological research** related to eye-tracking and brain function.
- Assisting **ophthalmologists** in diagnosing complex visual field defects.
